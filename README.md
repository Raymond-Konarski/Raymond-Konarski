- 👋 Hi, I’m @Raymond-Konarski
- 👀 I’m generally interested in computing as a whole, and still am yet to decide if I want to specialize in any area.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at the University of South Carolina
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project which fits my skill level! Said skill is still in the works, but I'm trying.
- 📫 I'm easiest to reach through the email konarskiraymond@gmail.com
